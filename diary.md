J.K. Lawder's paper on using Hilbert Curves for n-dimensional mapping: http://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~jkl/pubs/JL1_00a.pdf
Voronoi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram
VorTree: http://infolab.usc.edu/papers/VorTree.pdf

Need to include xy.js.

xy will provide Voronoi diagram calculator (or be included in one?)
